  JSX In React js
 
     JSX Stands for JavaScript XML
 
     JSX allows us to write HTML in React.

      JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
 
     In below example we have saw that we can use html element
     So that html element are called as JSX in React.
 
 

 ReactDOM.render(
   <h1>Zahid Chand </h1>,
   document.getElementById("root")
 );
 
 Render Multiple Elements(JSX) Inside ReactDOM.render()
 
   Till now we saw only 1 JSX in our render()
   What if we want multiple of them
   
     EG -->
       ReactDOM.render(
       <h1>Zahid Chand </h1>
       <p>Hello , We are learning React</p>,
       document.getElementById("root")
      );
      
      It will give us an error
  Error -->
     Parsing error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.
     Did you want a JSX fragment
     
     It's diplay us an error that render method will only take one element
 To solve that issue we have to pass it into one tag
 
  Let's suppose div tage and it will solve that problem.
 
 
 
  ReactDOM.render(
   <div>
     <h1>Zahid Chand </h1>
     <p>Hello , We are learning React</p>
   </div>,
   document.getElementById("root")
 );
 
 
 O/P -->
     Zahid Chand
      Hello , We are learning React
