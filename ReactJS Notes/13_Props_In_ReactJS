  ***Props In ReactJS***
  
  Props are arguments passed into React components.
     
     Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
     
     props stands for properties.
     
     React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
     
     To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:


 Lets consider an example If we want to greet more than one person
 
 
 
 import Greets from './Greets'
 
 
 ReactDOM.render(
      <>
           <Greets />
           <Greets />
           <Greets />

      </>,
      document.getElementById("root")
 );
 
 
 
  As we saw components are reuseable so we can use them whenever and wherever
  
  we want  and how many times we want.
 
  If we use <Greets /> 3 times then it will give us the same output
 
  Eg -->
         import Greets from './Greets'
ReactDOM.render(
     <>
          <Greets />
          <Greets />
          <Greets />
     </>,
     document.getElementById("root")
     );
    
    Output    -->
               Hello Zahid
               Hello Zahid
               Hello Zahid
 
     So we are greeting the same person 3 times, but what if we
     
     want to greet 3 different people
     
     In that case we have Props


 import Greets from './Greets'
 ReactDOM.render(
      <>
           <Greets name="Zahid">
                <p>
                     Hello This Is Child Paragraph Of Zahid
                </p>
           </Greets>
           <Greets name="Praveen" >
                <button>Click Me I'm Inside Praveen</button>
           </Greets>
           <Greets name="Clayton" />

      </>,
      document.getElementById("root")
 );
