  Props In ReactJS
  
  
  Props are arguments passed into React components.
     
     Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
     
     props stands for properties.
     
     React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
     
     To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:


 Lets consider an example If we want to greet more than one person
 
 
 
 import Greets from './Greets'
 ReactDOM.render(
      <>
           <Greets />
           <Greets />
           <Greets />

      </>,
      document.getElementById("root")
 );
