    When we use div tag then in browser when we inspect then we get div inside div 
  that means we are already passing that value to div tag whose id is root
  and again we are sending div from our JSX .
  So it can lead us to a problem that while applying css we can get some issue
  regarding that.
  So to solve that issue we have React Fragments
  We can use tag
  
  <React.Fragment>
     </React.Fragment>
     
     
     Eg -->

     ReactDOM.render(
        <React.Fragment>
          <h1>Zahid Chand </h1>
          <p>Hello , We are learning React</p>
        </React.Fragment>,
        document.getElementById("root")
      );
      
       Inside that we need to write our JSX

     NOTE --> React 16.2 has introduced a syntactical sugar for Fragments.
     <>
     </>
     
          This will also work
 ReactDOM.render(
   <>
     <h1>Zahid Chand </h1>
     <p>Hello , We are learning React</p>
   </>,
   document.getElementById("root")
 );
