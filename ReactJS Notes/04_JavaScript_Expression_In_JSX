We have saw how we use html in out js file
     But if we want to use Js again in our html element then we can use it
     by {} inside this
     
     
 const myName = "Heisenberg"
          ReactDOM.render(
          <h1>Say My Name myName</h1>,
          document.getElementById("root")
          );
          
 O/P --> Say My Name myName
        To use Js in HTML Element we need to add {} .


NOTE --->
              In this {} we can only use expression , we cannot use Statements
              Statements are if  else,switch etc we cannot use Statements.

 const myName = "Heisenberg"
 ReactDOM.render(
   <>
     <h1>Say My Name {myName}</h1>
     <p>We can also perform calculations inside -- {2 * 4}</p>
   </>,
   document.getElementById("root")
 );

   O/P-->  Say My Name Heisenberg
           We can also perform calculations inside -- 8
