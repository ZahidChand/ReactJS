Components_In_ReactJS

    Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
    
    Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
    
    They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
    
    Components come in two types, Class components and Function components,



 ***Class Component:--->
          A class component must include the extends React.Component statement.
          
          This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component,
          
          And gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
          
          The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.


 Eg --->
              Create a Class component called Car
              class Car extends React.Component {
                render() {
                  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                }
              }




    ***Function Component:--->
          A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves
          
          much the same way as a Class component, but Function components
          
          can be written using much less code, are easier to understand,

  Eg -->
        Create a Function component called Car
        function Car() {
          return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
        }
      NOTE--> We will mainly focus on Function Component

    Till now we have wrote using hard code without creating Components.
    Now we will learn how to create components.
    NOTE --> Component Name Should Start With First Letter Capital.
