/**
 *    Like in html element we have tags attributes
 * Eg -->
 *      <a href="" target=""></a>
 * So this href and target are attributes.
 * As we are using this JS in HTML its called as JSX and its attributes are
 * called as JSX Attributes
 *
 * To checkout more attributes just search HTML Global Attributes and
 * you will get all attributes.
